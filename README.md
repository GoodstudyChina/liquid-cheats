soviet | being a nonamer retard who tries to wannabe famous tf2 hvhers

also, i did not upload this, because of that nonamer called 'soviet' 's leak.
i re-programmed all of my projects a while ago, and this was rotting in my desktop/desktop/stuff/liquid-old/ folder.

i mean, why not upload it.
btw, you, the reader should only take this as a reference.

i commented out some shit and added some anti paste measurements on purprose.
ecks dee!
